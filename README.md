# Getting Started with Create React App

Build the folder with name tha are not CAPS and are url-friendly: google-maps-travel-companion.
within this folder in the terminal run : npx create-react-app ./
libraries to use: (start with npm install) @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab @react-google-maps/api axios google-map-react

## Components

Create a components folder. Each component gets its own folder within this head folder(components).
The components are Header, List, Map, PlaceDetails
In each componenets folder there shoould be a styling script placed. Name them 'styling.js'

## Google Cloud Platform

Vist 'console.cloud.google.com/createproject. 
Here you should name the project you are working with. After this choose the project and go to its dashboard -> Library.
Search for 'maps'. A list shall be given and choose "Maps Javascript API" and enable it.
You will be redirected to a page. In Enable APIs choose "Maps Javascript API" and on the left side go to credentials.
Click "Create Credentials" in the middle top and choose API key. You will be given a key. Copy That!!!!
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
